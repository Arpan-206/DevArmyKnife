## FAQ

#### Do you keep any of my data?

No, we don't keep any data of any sorts. In most of the tools the processing is done in the browser itself only where it is not technically possible do we do the processing on the server side.

#### Is it really free?

Yes, it is completely free. We don't have any trackers from our side. We only rely on your support end to continue this project.
